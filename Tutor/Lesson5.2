# Lesson 5.2: MORE ON WRITING FILES

** To save the changes made to the text, type `:w`{vim} FILENAME. **

 1. Type `:!ls`{vim} to get a listing of your directory.
    You already know you must hit `<Enter>`{normal} after this.

 2. Choose a filename that does not exist yet, such as TEST.

 3. Now type:
~~~ cmd
        :w TEST
~~~
   (where TEST is the filename you chose.)

 4. This saves the current file under the name TEST.
    To verify this, type `:!ls`{vim} again to see your directory.

NOTE: If you were to exit Neovim and start it again with `nvim TEST`, the file
      would be an exact copy of the tutorial when you saved it.

 5. Now remove the file by typing:
~~~ cmd
        :!rm TEST
~~~
