# Lesson 1 SUMMARY

     h (left)   j (down)       k (up)       l (right)

 2. To start Neovim from the shell prompt type:
~~~ sh
    $ nvim FILENAME

 3. To exit Neovim type: `<Esc>`{normal} `:q!`{vim} `<Enter>`{normal} to trash all changes.
                OR type: `<Esc>`{normal} `:wq`{vim} `<Enter>`{normal} to save the changes.

 4. To delete the character at the cursor type: `x`{normal}
