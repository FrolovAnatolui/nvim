# Lesson 4.4: THE SUBSTITUTE COMMAND

** Type `:s/old/new/g` to substitute "new" for "old". **

 1. Move the cursor to the line below marked âœ—.

 2. Type
~~~ cmd
        :s/thee/the/
~~~
    NOTE: the [:s](:s) command only changed the first match of "thee" in the line.

 3. Now type
~~~ cmd
        :s/thee/the/g
~~~
    Adding the g [flag](:s_flags) means to substitute globally in the line,
    change all occurrences of "thee" in the line.

Usually thee best time to see thee flowers is in thee spring.

 4. To change every occurrence of a character string between two lines, type
~~~ cmd
        :#,#s/old/new/g
~~~
    where # are the line numbers of the range of lines where the
    substitution is to be done (i.e., `1,3` means from line 1 to line 3, inclusive).

    Type
~~~ cmd
        :%s/old/new/g
~~~
    to change every occurrence in the whole file.

    Type
~~~ cmd
        :%s/old/new/gc
~~~
    to find every occurrence in the whole file, with a prompt whether to
    substitute or not.

NOTE: You can also select the lines you want to substitute first using visual-mode.
      This will be explained more in a future lesson.
