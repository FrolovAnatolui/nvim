# Lesson 5.1: HOW TO EXECUTE AN EXTERNAL COMMAND

** Type `:!`{vim} followed by an external command to execute that command. **

 1. Type the familiar command `:`{normal} to set the cursor at the bottom of
    the screen. This allows you to enter a command-line command.

 2. Now type the [!](!cmd) (exclamation point) character. This allows you to
    execute any external shell command.

 3. As an example type "ls" following the "!" and then hit `<Enter>`{normal}.
    This will show you a listing of your directory, just as if you were
    at the shell prompt.

NOTE: It is possible to execute any external command this way, and you
      can include arguments.

NOTE: All `:`{vim} commands are executed when you press `<Enter>`{normal}.
