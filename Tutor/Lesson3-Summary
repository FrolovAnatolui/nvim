# Lesson 3 SUMMARY

 1. To put back text that has just been deleted, type [p](p). This puts the
    deleted text AFTER the cursor (if a line was deleted it will go on the
    line below the cursor).

 2. To replace the character under the cursor, type [r](r) and then the
    character you want to have there.

 3. The [change operator](c) allows you to change from the cursor to where
    the motion takes you. Type `ce`{normal} to change from the cursor to the
    end of the word, `c$`{normal} to change to the end of a line, etc.

 4. The format for change is:

        c   [number]   motion
