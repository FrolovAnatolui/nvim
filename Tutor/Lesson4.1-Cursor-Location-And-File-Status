# Lesson 4.1: CURSOR LOCATION AND FILE STATUS

** Type `<C-g>`{normal} to show your location in a file and the file status.
 Type `G`{normal} to move to a line in the file. **

NOTE: Read the entire lesson before executing any of these steps!!

 1. Hold down the `<Ctrl>`{normal} key and press `g`{normal}. We call this `<C-g>`{normal}.
    A message will appear at the bottom of the page with the filename and
    the position in the file. Remember the line number for Step 3.

NOTE: You may see the cursor position in the lower right corner of the
      screen. This happens when the ['ruler']('ruler') option is set.

 2. Press [G](G) to move you to the bottom of the file.
    Type [gg](gg) to move you to the start of the file.

 3. Type the number of the line you were on and then `G`{normal}. This will
    return you to the line you were on when you first pressed `<C-g>`{normal}.

 4. If you feel confident to do this, execute steps 1 through 3.
