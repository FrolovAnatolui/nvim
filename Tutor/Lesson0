# Lesson 0

NOTE: The commands in the lessons will modify the text, but those changes
won't be saved. Don't worry about messing things up; just remember that
pressing [<Esc>](<Esc>) and then [u](u) will undo the latest change.

This tutorial is interactive, and there are a few things you should know.
- Type [<Enter>](<Enter>) on links [like this](holy-grail    ) to open the linked help section.
- Or simply type [K](K) on any word to find its documentation!
- You can close this help window with `:q`{vim}
- Sometimes you will be required to modify text like

    this here

Once you have done the changes correctly, the ✗ sign at the left will change
to ✓. I imagine you can already see how neat Neovim can be.
Other times, you'll be prompted to run a command (I'll explain this later):
~~~ cmd
    :help <Enter>
~~~
or press a sequence of keys
~~~ normal
    <Esc>0f<Space>d3wP$P
~~~
Text within <'s and >'s (like `<Enter>`{normal}) describes a key to press
instead of text to type.

Now, move to the next lesson (use the `j`{normal} key to scroll down).
